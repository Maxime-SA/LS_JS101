RULES OF THE GAME

  There are 13 cards per suit (2 through 10 plus Jack, Queen, King, and Ace)

  There are 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades)

  Each numbered card is worth their face value

  The Jack, Queen, and King are each worth ten points whereas the Ace is either worth 1 or 11 point(s), depending on the hand

  Both the dealer and the player are initially given two cards
  The player can see their two cards but only one from the dealer

  The player can keep asking for more cards until he either decides to stop or he goes over 21

  Once the player is done, the dealer keeps getting more cards until he's total is at least 17

  Once both players are done, we calculate the total and whoever has the number wins

  I need a function that will return an initialized deck of cards

  I need to give two cards to each player and show one of the dealer's card

  I need to keep asking the player for more cards until he decides to stop or he goes over
  I need to keep the score in some kind of object
  If he goes over the dealer wins right away

  I need to keep giving the dealer cards until he busts or has at least 17
  I need to keep the score in some kind of object
  If he goes over the player wins right away

  I compare the total from both players
